### Real Estate Listings Maps

Google Maps is integrated into each listing. When adding a listing, you simply need to start typing the address and Google will help you find the exact address and location. You can even move the map marker and place wherever you like.

### Real Estate Listings Search

The search box is extremely smart. 

It uses a combination of Google Maps Geocoding, radius searching and traditional searching for keywords to help find relevant results. As well as this it also has a number of attributes to help narrow the results such as Type of property, min & max bedrooms, min & max price, Buy or Rent and more.

>Try out our [search box](http://listings-wp.com/real-estate-listings?utm_source=plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=search_box) here and see how smart it is.

A robust, flexible framework & template system gives you full control over every aspect of your real estate website, so you can customize it to fit your needs.
